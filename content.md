# 🦠 What about strains? 🦠

<div class="content">

## 🧬 Describing a genotype

The genotype of a strain is a **list of the alleles that differ from the wild-type or reference strain**. If we can describe an allele, we can describe a **genotype as an array of alleles**.

## 🤔 What's an allele then?

Since ShareYourCloning gives us a standard format to describe cloning strategies, we can describe an **allele as a sequence that originated from a fragment the reference genome sequence**.
* We store the genome coordinates of the template sequence used as input.
* We store the product sequence, and cloning strategy.

For example:

## 🦠 How do you define a strain source?

1. Strain sources that generate new alleles have an associated "Allele Source".

</div>

2. Mating is just a shuffling of existing alleles
